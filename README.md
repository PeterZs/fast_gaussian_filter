# Chainer Implementation of Fast Gaussian Filter

This is an unofficial code for the paper [Fast High-Dimensional Filtering Using the Permutohedral Lattice \[Adams+ Eurographics 2010\]](
Fast High-Dimensional Filtering Using the Permutohedral Lattice).

This GPU implementation is faster (104 &plusmn; 1 ms on GTX 970) than the authors' CPU implementation (827 &plusmn; 4 ms on Core i5-2400).

This code supports derivative of the output image with respect to the input image for neural networks.
